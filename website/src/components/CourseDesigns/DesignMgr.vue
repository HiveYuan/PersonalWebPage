					intro:"Sky is a common background in photos, but because of the limited time of photographing, " +
						"it is usually not very interesting. In this project, we proposed an automatic background replacement " +
						"algorithm that can generate realistic, artifact-free images with a diverse styles of skies. " +
						"The key idea of our algorithm is to use semantic segmentation to guide the entire process, " +
						"including sky segmentation, replacement, color transfer and guide filter. Plus, we implement our algorithm " +
						"into video process. Even if it canâ€™t be played real time, the outcome still performs well.",
